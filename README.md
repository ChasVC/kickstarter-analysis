# Purpose

To confirm learnings from the initial weeks of DS Bootcamp, specifically those revolving around Excel and Github - including "My First ReadMe", which will be nowhere near as brilliant as [these gems](https://github.com/matiassingers/awesome-readme).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

As a daily user of Excel and functions not covered in class, I've had to proactively resist using my day-to-day methodologies. I'm aiming to complete assignments exactly as instructed, and disabling a bit of muscle memory.

## Results

### What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- Campaigns started during Q2 perform slightly better than those started during Q's 1, 2, and 4.  These points hold true for "Theater" projects specifically, and all project types 	generally.

- For Theater campaigns, Q2 and Q3 are more popular start periods than Qs 1 and 4.

### What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- Results are mixed with most campaigns having a roughly 45% chance of hitting thier threshold for "Success". While the prescribed graph ("Outcomes Based on Goal") indicates much better performance for campaings with high-dollar targets, the visual may be deceiving as there were far fewer campaigns at the upper dollar tiers. Campaigns with a target of $1,000 - $4,999 where most successful.

### What are some limitations of this dataset?

- With the most recent campaign start date being March of 2017, the date is a several years old and may not reflect current market behaviors.

- No information is included that speaks to marketing efforts for the campaings, so there is no way to tell, for example, if campaigns failed for lack of promotional effort. There may be more to the story than the data allows us to ascertain.


### What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?

- Comparisons between Categories and Subcategories, visualizations that help to surface the most consistenly underperforming varients -- helpful when Orgs need to eliminate wasted 	efforts.

- Wider views of time, specifically one that rolls up starts by Quarter.

- Campaign length VS various success/failure measures! Help the viewer determine the sweetspots!
